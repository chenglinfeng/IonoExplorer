# IonoExplorer

The Ionosphere is part of Earth’s upper atmosphere, roughly 50 to 400 miles above Earth’s surface. The ionosphere is important because it reflects and modifies radio waves used for communication and navigation. In this project we developed an Android App for real-time sounding and data processing of Ionosphere.
